    "summary": "Inflation Accounting and Corporate Taxation by Tapas Kumar Sen (1987) examines the impact of inflation on financial reporting and corporate taxation, particularly in the context of developing economies like India. The book discusses how traditional accounting practices\u2014which record transactions at historical cost\u2014can distort financial statements during periods of inflation, leading to inaccurate profit reporting, asset valuation, and tax liabilities. It explores alternative accounting methods, such as current cost accounting and price-level adjustments, to provide a more realistic view of corporate financial performance. Additionally, the text analyzes the implications of inflation-adjusted accounting for corporate tax policy, showing how it could lead to fairer taxation and better fiscal planning. This concise and analytical work is valuable for finance professionals, policymakers, and students in public finance and corporate accounting.",
