    "summary": "This book is a collection of academic papers (proceedings) from a conference held in 2004. The content focuses on \"pervasive computing,\" which is the idea of computers being embedded everywhere in the environment (also known as ubiquitous computing or the Internet of Things). The papers likely discuss research on topics like mobile devices, sensor networks, and smart environments.",
